## Automock 2.x → Suites 3.x

Automock has renamed to Suites, maintaining the core philosophy while adding new features and improvements.
**Automock 2.x** receives critical bug fixes only, while **Suites 3.x** is the actively developed version with all new
features and enhancements.

## Documentation

**The complete Automock documentation has been moved to the [Suites Wiki](https://github.com/suites-dev/suites/wiki).**

## Migration to Suites (version 3)

See the [Migration Guide](https://suites.dev/docs/migration-guides/from-automock) for step-by-step instructions.

**Automated migration** via `@suites/codemod` is planned for Q1 2026.

### ⚠️ Deprecation timeline
A formal deprecation date for Automock v2 will be announced once the codemod tool is stable to ensure a smooth automated migration path.
