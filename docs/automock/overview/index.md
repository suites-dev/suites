# Automock Documentation Archive

> **Note:** Automock has been deprecated and transformed into [Suites](https://suites.dev). This documentation is kept as an archive for historical reference and to help users migrating from Automock.

## Overview of Automock

Automock was a framework for unit testing applications built with dependency injection. It created a simplified, virtual DI container for tests that automatically handled dependency mocking and wiring, making it easier to write clean, maintainable tests.

Key aspects of Automock included:

- **Automatic dependency mocking** - Replace all dependencies with mocks in one line of code
- **Framework agnostic** - Works with popular DI frameworks like NestJS, InversifyJS, and more
- **Adaptable to your testing library** - Integrates with Jest, Sinon, and others
- **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript support with accurate type inference
