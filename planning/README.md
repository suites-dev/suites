## ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL INSIGHTS

### 1. Tokens Are Natural Boundaries (NOT I/O!)

**CODE PROOF** (`dependency-resolver.ts:46-51, 93-103`):
```typescript
// Priority 3: Tokens ALWAYS mocked BEFORE boundaries check
if (this.isLeafOrPrimitive(identifier)) {  // typeof !== 'function' = token
  const mock = this.mockFunction();
  return mock;
}
```

**What This Means**:
- `@Inject('PRISMA')` â†’ Always mocked (token)
- `@Inject('DATABASE')` â†’ Always mocked (token)
- I/O is ALREADY isolated via tokens!

**Boundaries is NOT for I/O isolation!**

### 2. What Boundaries Is Actually For

Mock **expensive/external CLASS dependencies**:
- ML/AI services (`RecommendationEngine`)
- Heavy computation services
- Third-party SDK wrappers (when classes, not tokens)
- Flaky services

**NOT for I/O** - tokens handle that automatically!

### 3. Fail-Fast Is Critical in Expose Mode

The "lying tests" problem happens in **expose mode** where:
- Non-exposed deps â†’ auto-mocked â†’ return `undefined`
- Tests pass with undefined â†’ bugs reach production

Fail-fast prevents this by throwing instead of returning `undefined`.

## The Core Problem & Solution

### Problem (GitHub Discussion #655 + Issue #820)
1. **Tedious configuration**: Users must call `.expose()` dozens of times
2. **Lying tests**: Tests pass when they should fail due to silent `undefined`

### Solution: Two Features
1. **`.boundaries()`** - Inverts mental model, mocks only (expensive/flaky) class boundaries
2. **Fail-fast** - Throws errors instead of returning `undefined`

## Key Design Decisions

- **Breaking change accepted**: Fail-fast ON by default for safety
- **Modes are mutually exclusive**: Can't mix `.expose()` and `.boundaries()`
- **Tokens always mocked**: Natural boundaries regardless of mode (Priority 3)
- **Simple API**: Just `.boundaries()` and `.disableFailFast()`
- **Single responsibility**: Error messages only in builder, resolver is pure logic
- **No optionals**: All parameters explicit for clarity

## Example: The Transformation

```typescript
// v3.x - Tedious
TestBed.sociable(UserService)
  .expose(ServiceA)
  .expose(ServiceB)
  .expose(ServiceC)
  // ... 20 more lines
  .compile();

// v4.0 - Simple
TestBed.sociable(UserService)
  .boundaries([DatabaseService, HttpClient]) // Just mock I/O
  .compile();
```

## For Documentation Website

Key messages for users:
1. **Boundaries simplify configuration** for large codebases
2. **Fail-fast prevents production bugs** by catching issues in tests
3. **Migration is gradual** with `.disableFailFast()` escape hatch
4. **Mental models are clear** with mutually exclusive modes

## Technical Implementation

- **~275 lines of code** including tests
- **Non-breaking type changes** (expansion, not restriction)
- **3-week timeline** for implementation
- **Backward compatible** with escape hatches

## Success Metrics

With 500K monthly downloads, success means:
- Fewer production bugs (fail-fast)
- Faster test writing (boundaries)
- Clear mental models (mutual exclusivity)
- Smooth migration (escape hatches)
